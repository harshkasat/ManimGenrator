We begin by visualizing a 2D landscape represented

2
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:06,012
by a height map A ball starts at

3
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:08,800
a random point on this landscape The ball

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,650
iteratively rolls uphill always choosing the steepest direction

5
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:14,875
Notice how the ball gets stuck at a

6
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:19,275
local maximum This demonstrates how gradient ascent algorithms

7
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:22,525
can get trapped in local optima The algorithm

8
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:24,725
is now stuck and cannot find the true

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,812
global maximum This highlights the local optima issue

10
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:31,400
in optimization problems ` ` `
