` ` ` Welcome to Symmetry and Shapes

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:04,574
! Let's start with a square

3
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:06,375
. Notice its perfect symmetry

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,737
. Here are its lines of symmetry :

5
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:11,449
vertical , horizontal , and both diagonals

6
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,949
. Now , an equilateral triangle

7
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:15,974
. It also has lines of symmetry

8
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:18,887
. These lines run from each vertex to

9
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,725
the midpoint of the opposite side

10
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:22,625
. Finally , a circle

11
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:25,125
. A circle has infinite lines of symmetry

12
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,825
. Watch this line rotate , showing just

13
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,650
some of the infinite possibilities

14
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:31,600
. Symmetry is everywhere

15
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:32,425
