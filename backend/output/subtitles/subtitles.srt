1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:02,450
We begin with a grid of numbers starting

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,599
from 2 Now circles will grow to eliminate

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,875
multiples of each prime number Watch as the

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,525
multiples are crossed out one by one The

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,200
remaining numbers are the prime numbers less than

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,262
100 These are the prime numbers revealed by

7
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:18,000
the sieve
