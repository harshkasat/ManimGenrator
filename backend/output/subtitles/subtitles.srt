00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,075
Let's explore the fascinating world of patterns in

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:06,912
multiplication We can easily see patterns by looking

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,225
at a multiplication table Notice how the multiples

4
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:13,700
of three form a distinct pattern Anything multiplied

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,699
by zero always results in zero Multiplying any

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,149
number by one results in the same number

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,562
Multiplying by ten simply adds a zero to

8
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:26,262
the end of the number Squaring a number

9
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:30,024
means multiplying the number by itself Recognizing these

10
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:32,974
patterns makes multiplication much easier
