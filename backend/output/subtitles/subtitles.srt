The Gaussian blur a seemingly complex effect is

2
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:06,812
actually quite simple It's all about averaging imagine

3
00:00:06,812 --> 00:00:08,987
you have an image represented by a grid

4
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:12,074
of pixels Each pixel has a value and

5
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:15,149
blurring involves averaging the value of each pixel

6
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,524
with its neighbors Let's focus on one pixel

7
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:21,412
and its immediate neighbors The new value of

8
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,399
this pixel is calculated by taking the average

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,587
of its current value and the values of

10
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:30,287
its neighbors This averaging process is applied to

11
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,537
all pixels in the image Repeatedly applying this

12
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:37,600
averaging process smooths out sharp transitions and reduces

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,312
noise That's how a Gaussian blur works a

14
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:43,024
simple yet powerful averaging technique
