Give me one original video idea that:
1. Is short (suitable for under 60 seconds),
2. Can be explained visually using Manim,
3. Has an intuitive "aha" insight,
4. Is beginner-friendly but mind-expanding.
The idea should be described in 2â€“3 sentences, enough for me to storyboard and animate it."""
